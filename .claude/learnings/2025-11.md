TDD with Claude is incredibly effective - writing tests first prevents over-engineering and ensures focused implementation. The RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle kept me disciplined throughout the entire web interface backend implementation.

Port conflicts in tests can be avoided by using unique ports per test and proper cleanup with server.close(). Adding _resetWebSocketState() helped isolate test state and prevent leaks between test runs.

When integrating CommonJS modules into ES modules, use createRequire from node:module to enable require() in ES module context. This allows gradual migration without rewriting existing CommonJS code.

Atomic commits (1-3 files) make code review easier and git history more navigable. Each commit in the TDD cycle (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR) represented a logical unit of work that could be understood independently.
