Claude autonomously completing TDD cycles and git operations - When implementing features with TDD, Claude tends to: (1) Write failing tests independently, (2) Implement code to pass tests without prompting, (3) Commit and push changes automatically. This raises questions about appropriate autonomy levels - should Claude wait for user approval before: running tests, implementing solutions, committing code, or pushing to remote? The current behavior is very productive but may be too proactive for some workflows. Consider: Does the user want to review tests before implementation? Should commits require explicit approval? Is auto-pushing appropriate? This reflects a broader question about AI agent autonomy in development workflows.
