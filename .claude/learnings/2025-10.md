Claude autonomously completing TDD cycles and git operations - When implementing features with TDD, Claude tends to: (1) Write failing tests independently, (2) Implement code to pass tests without prompting, (3) Commit and push changes automatically. This raises questions about appropriate autonomy levels - should Claude wait for user approval before: running tests, implementing solutions, committing code, or pushing to remote? The current behavior is very productive but may be too proactive for some workflows. Consider: Does the user want to review tests before implementation? Should commits require explicit approval? Is auto-pushing appropriate? This reflects a broader question about AI agent autonomy in development workflows.

Beam Search Iteration 0 is a special case and should not be abstracted into the main loop. It has a fundamentally different entry point (starts at expansion/combine stage) compared to iteration 1+ (starts at critique stage). Using Solution 2 (explicit special-casing) rather than synthetic state or over-abstraction. This reflects the actual algorithm structure where iteration 0 expands from terse user prompt while iteration 1+ refines based on critique. Code shares the same building blocks (processCandidateStream, llm.refinePrompt, rankAndSelect) but has legitimately different control flow.
