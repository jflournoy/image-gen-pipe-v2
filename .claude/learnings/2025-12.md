Ensemble voting with dimensional ties: Allowing both images to receive rank=1 on individual dimensions (alignment/aesthetics) is sound design. It provides more fidelity than forcing artificial winners. The ensemble + weighting system handles ties well—ties on one dimension are overcome by strong signal on others, preventing noise injection. Per-dimension averaging first (before combining) properly weights each factor's contribution.
