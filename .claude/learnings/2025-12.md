Ensemble voting with dimensional ties: Allowing both images to receive rank=1 on individual dimensions (alignment/aesthetics) is sound design. It provides more fidelity than forcing artificial winners. The ensemble + weighting system handles ties well—ties on one dimension are overcome by strong signal on others, preventing noise injection. Per-dimension averaging first (before combining) properly weights each factor's contribution.

Token Tracking Verification Complete: Image generation dominates beam search costs (99%), making it primary optimization target. All 11 API calls tracked with automatic cost estimation. Key lesson: generic fallback pricing must be defined (image: 0.04) for cost calculations to work. Documentation-first verification approach enabled 100% coverage confirmation.
